Question 1: [Index] S&P 500 Stocks Added to the Index
Which year had the highest number of additions?

Using the list of S&P 500 companies from Wikipedia's S&P 500 companies page, download the data including the year each company was added to the index.

Hint: you can use pandas.read_html to scrape the data into a DataFrame.

Steps:

Create a DataFrame with company tickers, names, and the year they were added.
Extract the year from the addition date and calculate the number of stocks added each year.
Which year had the highest number of additions (1957 doesn't count, as it was the year when the S&P 500 index was founded)? Write down this year as your answer (the most recent one, if you have several records).
Context:

"Following the announcement, all four new entrants saw their stock prices rise in extended trading on Friday" - recent examples of S&P 500 additions include DASH, WSM, EXE, TKO in 2025 (Nasdaq article).

Additional: How many current S&P 500 stocks have been in the index for more than 20 years? When stocks are added to the S&P 500, they usually experience a price bump as investors and index funds buy shares following the announcement.

Question 3. [Index] S&P 500 Market Corrections Analysis
Calculate the median duration (in days) of significant market corrections in the S&P 500 index.

For this task, define a correction as an event when a stock index goes down by more than 5% from the closest all-time high maximum.

Steps:

Download S&P 500 historical data (1950-present) using yfinance
Identify all-time high points (where price exceeds all previous prices)
For each pair of consecutive all-time highs, find the minimum price in between
Calculate drawdown percentages: (high - low) / high Ã— 100
Filter for corrections with at least 5% drawdown
Calculate the duration in days for each correction period
Determine the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles for correction durations
Context:

Investors often wonder about the typical length of market corrections when deciding "when to buy the dip" (Reddit discussion).

Question 4. [Stocks] Earnings Surprise Analysis for Amazon (AMZN)
Calculate the median 2-day percentage change in stock prices following positive earnings surprises days.

Steps:

Load earnings data from CSV (ha1_Amazon.csv) containing earnings dates, EPS estimates, and actual EPS. Make sure you are using the correct delimiter to read the data, such as in this command python pandas.read_csv("ha1_Amazon.csv", delimiter=';') 
Download complete historical price data using yfinance
Calculate 2-day percentage changes for all historical dates: for each sequence of 3 consecutive trading days (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3), compute the return as Close_Day3 / Close_Day1 - 1. (Assume Day 2 may correspond to the earnings announcement.)
Identify positive earnings surprises (where "actual EPS > estimated EPS" OR "Surprise (%)>0")
Calculate 2-day percentage changes following positive earnings surprises. Show your answer in % (closest number to the 2nd digit): return * 100.0
(Optional) Compare the median 2-day percentage change for positive surprises vs. all historical dates. Do you see the difference?
Context: Earnings announcements, especially when they exceed analyst expectations, can significantly impact stock prices in the short term.

Additional: Is there a correlation between the magnitude of the earnings surprise and the stock price reaction? Does the market react differently to earnings surprises during bull vs. bear markets?)
